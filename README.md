# Restaurant Poll

This application consists of a POC (Proof of Concept) with the objective of solving the 30 minutes spent by the DBServer teams, every day, in order to select a restaurant to have their lunch. It consists of a Poll application, where *a professional can only vote in a restaurant per day* and *a restaurant can only be chosen once per week*. Taking into consideration it's a POC application many features will be mocked with "fake" data. This will be divided into two parts a **backend** built on top of **NodeJS** and a **frontend** built on **ReactJS**
